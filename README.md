# Zilog Cafe

Made in Late 2013 - Early 2014. This is a prototype of an app for purchasing food using the iPhone. This was way before Uber Eats or Cornershop existed.

Sadly due to lack of funding this never really took off.

## Technology

- Parse Framework
- Objective-C

## Video

Because Parse.com is no longer active and the old nature of this code this app cannot be run,

But at least it has a video recorded for posterity.

The "Cafeta" was a rebranding made for a specific presentation.
